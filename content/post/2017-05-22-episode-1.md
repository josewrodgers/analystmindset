## Background

In the first episode of Analyst Mindset I (more or less on a whim) decided to look at the lengths of each of the episodes of Not So Standard Deviations, a data science podcast I do with Hilary Parker. 

## Goal

Examine the relationship between the length of each episode and time/episode number to see if there's any trend in the episode lengths over time.
